# SKY --- Device Community Website

> **SKY --- Built for everyone.**

Official community website for **SKY**, an Android smartphone/device
project.

## Overview

This project is the web platform for the SKY device community. It
provides a clean, minimal, PixelOS-inspired experience while keeping the
focus on useful device and community information.

**Live website:** https://sky-roms.vercel.app/

## Features

-   SKY landing page
-   Device information and specifications
-   Available AOSP/custom ROM directory
-   ROM information and details
-   Admin and developer profiles
-   Community/project information
-   Responsive desktop and mobile experience
-   Dark and light themes
-   Smooth, subtle animations
-   Custom 404 page
-   Vercel deployment

## Design Direction

The visual direction is inspired by modern Android/open-source project
websites, particularly the simple, content-focused approach associated
with PixelOS.

The goal is to keep the interface:

-   Minimal
-   Fast
-   Content-focused
-   Responsive
-   Professional
-   Easy to maintain

Animations and decorative effects are secondary to the actual project
information.

## ROM Directory

The website can present available ROMs for SKY with information such as:

-   ROM name
-   Android version
-   Official / Unofficial status
-   Maintainer
-   Latest build
-   Download/source information

Only verified project information should be presented as real device or
ROM data.

## Team

The website includes profiles for SKY administrators and developers,
recognizing the people responsible for maintaining and developing the
project.

## Development

Clone the repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/sky-roms/sky-website-app.git
cd Sky-website-app
```

```

Start the production server:

``` bash

``` text

The connected production branch can automatically trigger a new Vercel
deployment when changes are pushed.
